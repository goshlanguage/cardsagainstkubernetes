# Cards Against Kubernetes

An HTML5 party game for you and your nerdy friends! Sure to receive a DCMA notice, this React App is meant to allow you to start or join a session of the familiar adlib-esc card game about Kubernetes, and the trials and tribulations there-in.

## Development

### Getting started

The web facing element is a [react](https://reactjs.org/) app, and `react` is a javascript framework. Don't know Javascript? Don't despair!

A takeaway might be that react allows you to define HTML tags such that instead of defining a `<header>`, you could define what your header looks like, and pass in any parameters so that to display your header, you use a `<Header />` tag for instace. This is called `JSX` and is a syntax extension to javascript, you can [read more here](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).


### API Codegen

The API that serves cardsagainstkubernetes is partially autogenerated from openapi spec.
